    2. Recursion   - base/recursive cases, call stack, basic vs tail recursion, recursion tree, divide & conquer, backtracking (subsets, permutations, combination sum, N-Queens)

    3. Sorting Algorithms   - bubble, selection, insertion, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, counting sort, radix sort, stability, in-place vs out-of-place

    4. Searching Algorithms   - linear search, binary search, lower/upper bound, first/last occurrence, search in rotated array, ternary search concept

    5. Graph Algorithms   - adjacency list/matrix, BFS, DFS, cycle detection, topological sort, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal, Prim, Disjoint Set Union
