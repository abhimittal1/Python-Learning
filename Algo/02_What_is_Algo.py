What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a specific problem. 
It is a set of instructions that takes an input, processes it, and produces an output. 
Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used in various applications, from simple calculations to complex data processing tasks.

example:
1. when we multiply two numbers, we follow a specific set of steps to arrive at the product.
2. when we sort a list of items, we use algorithms like bubble sort or quicksort to arrange them in a specific order.

Properties of Algorithms:
1. Finiteness: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
2. Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm must be clearly and unambiguously defined.
3. Input: An algorithm should have zero or more inputs.
4. Output: An algorithm should produce at least one output.
5. Effectiveness: The steps of the algorithm must be basic enough to be carried out, in principle, by a person using only pencil and paper.


Types of Algorithms:
1. Sorting Algorithms: Arrange data in a particular order (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort).
2. Searching Algorithms: Find specific data within a structure (e.g., binary search, linear search).
3. Graph Algorithms: Solve problems related to graph structures (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS, DFS).
4. Dynamic Programming: Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem).
5. Greedy Algorithms: Make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment (e.g., Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm).
